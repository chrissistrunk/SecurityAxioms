Computer Security Axioms:
1. If a system or network is vulnerable to legacy malware, then it is certainly vulnerable to targeted attacks. (Sistrunk's Axiom)
2. If an attacker can use an existing feature of a targeted system, then they aren't required to use a zero-day. (Ralph Langner?)
3. Give a man an 0day and he'll have access for a day, teach a man to phish and he'll have access for life. (@thegrugq)
