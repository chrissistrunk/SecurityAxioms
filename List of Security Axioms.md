Computer Security Axioms:
1. If a system or network is vulnerable to legacy malware, then it is certainly vulnerable to targeted attacks. (Sistrunk's Axiom)
2. If an attacker can use an existing feature of a targeted system, then they aren't required to use a zero-day. (Ralph Langner?)
3. Give a man an 0day and he'll have access for a day, teach a man to phish and he'll have access for life. (@thegrugq)
4. Compliance does not equal security. (unknown)
5. A backdoor for one is a backdoor for everyone. (@munin)
6. Security is a journey, not a destination (unknown)
   a. Earliest reference to full quote above is by Joel G. Ogren in 1999.
   b. "Security is a process, not an end state." Mitch Kabay 1998
   c. "Security is a process, not a product." Bruce Schneier 1999
